# N4SID-and-MOESP
These are numerical algorithms for subspace state space system identification. The book that use as reference it will be "Subspace Methods  for System Identification" from Tohru Katayama

# (MOESP algorithm)
Step 1: Compute the LQ decomposition of (6.32).

Step 2: Compute the SVD of (6.39), and let $n := dim \Sigma_{1}$ and define the extended observability matrix as

Step 3: Obtain  and  from (6.41) and (6.42), respectively.

Step 4: Solve (6.44) by the least-squares method to estimate  and  .
